#### I. Description of the Problem
1. *What is the project about?*

    This project started as an idea to play around with reinforcment learning as well as the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP). Find the most efficient route for my fiance and I to take while we travel around the United States. 
    
    Utilizing a Genetic Algorithm the program will attempted to find the shortest route between 15 American locations:
    - Denver, CO
    - Colorado Springs, CO
    - Telluride, CO
    - Las Vegas, NV
    - Grand Canyon, AZ
    - Yellowstone National Park, WY
    - Mount Rushmore, SD
    - Seattle, WA
    - Redwood National Park, CA
    - San Diego, CA
    - Los Angeles, CA
    - Mount Hood National Forest, OR
    - Santa Fe, NM
    - Chicago, IL
    - New York, NY
